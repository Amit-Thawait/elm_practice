**Pure function :**

* A function that takes atleast 1 parameter, must not use state, must return a value and must not cause any side effects.

* A pure function always produces same output for the same input.

* Side effect means the function does something in addition to returning a value like modifying state or making Http request, basically interacting with the outside world in any way besides returning a value.

Some of the benefits or pure function :

1. Resuable
2. Composable
3. Testable
4. Cacheable
